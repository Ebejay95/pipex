# pipex

**A simplified shell pipeline implementation in C**

## Summary

The **pipex** project focuses on recreating the functionality of the Unix shell's pipeline feature. It allows the chaining of commands using pipes while handling file redirection and inter-process communication. Through this project, you will gain a deeper understanding of process management, file descriptors, and Unix system calls.

## Features

### Core Functionality

- **Pipeline Execution**: Replicates the behavior of shell pipelines:
  ```
  < file1 cmd1 | cmd2 > file2
  ```
File Redirection: Supports input (file1) and output (file2) redirection.
Robust Error Handling:
Handles invalid commands, inaccessible files, and system call errors.
Mimics shell-like behavior for redirection errors.
Bonus Features (Optional)
Multi-Pipeline Support:
  ```
./pipex file1 cmd1 cmd2 cmd3 ... cmdn file2
  ```
Behaves like:
  ```
< file1 cmd1 | cmd2 | cmd3 ... | cmdn > file2
  ```
Here-Document Support:
  ```
./pipex here_doc LIMITER cmd cmd1 file
  ```
Behaves like:
  ```
cmd << LIMITER | cmd1 >> file
  ```
Structure
Directories
src/
pipex.c: Implements the main pipeline execution logic and command handling.
pipex_utils.c: Contains utility functions for error handling, path resolution, and argument parsing.
file_operations.c: Manages file opening, redirection, and cleanup.
includes/
pipex.h: Declares function prototypes, macros, and shared definitions.
Key Files
Makefile: Automates compilation with targets for mandatory and bonus implementations:
all, clean, fclean, re, and bonus.
Examples
Basic Pipeline:
```
./pipex infile "ls -l" "wc -l" outfile
```
Equivalent to:
```
< infile ls -l | wc -l > outfile
```
With Grep:
```
./pipex infile "grep a1" "wc -w" outfile
```
Equivalent to:
```
< infile grep a1 | wc -w > outfile
```
Here-Document (Bonus):

```
./pipex here_doc LIMITER "grep something" "wc -l" outfile
```
Equivalent to:
```
grep something << LIMITER | wc -l >> outfile
```
